**An experimental tech demo about, you guessed it, flipping a coin**

**created by ritz (@enfier)**

It's a game about flipping a coin. Not much else.

You can get heads, tails or a secret stalemate option.

You're able to view your session stats as well.

Created in a day as a tech demo for my main game, [Auxilium](https://github.com/enfier/Auxilium).

Demonstrates a random number generator and an incremental counter.

Made in Batch. Small file size. Free download. Windows only.
